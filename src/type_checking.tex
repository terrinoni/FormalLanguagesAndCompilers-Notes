\emph{Type Checking} is the process used for the verification of types constraints:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	can be performed at compiling time (static check) or at execution time (dynamic check);
	\item
	dynamic types appear more often in interpreted languages, whereas compiled languages favour static types;
	\item
	static checking is one of the main semantic tasks performed by a compiler.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Type Systems}
\begin{description}
	\item[Base Types]
	Programming languages typically include base types for numbers, characters, and boolean.
	\item[Compound and Constructed Types]
	Programmers need higher level abstractions than the base types.
	Programming languages provide mechanisms to combine and aggregate objects and to derive types for the resulting objects.
\end{description}
A type system consists in a set of base types and a set of type constructors.
Using base types and type constructors each expression in a program can be represented with a type expression.
