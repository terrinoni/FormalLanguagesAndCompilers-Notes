{"name":"Formal Languages and Compilers","tagline":"Notes from the course \"Formal Languages and Compilers\", Polytechnic University of Turin 2012","body":"## Welcome\r\nThis is the GitHub Page for the notes collection project related to the course \"Formal Languages and Compilers\" (2012), prof. [Silvano Rivoira](http://staff.polito.it/silvano.rivoira/), from Polytechnic University of Turin.\r\nThe final document, which is built in LaTeX, consists in a PDF file, in order to make the collection readable in almost every device.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this is just a homemade collection of personal notes **without any approval from University or prof. Rivoira**.\r\nI'm not responsible for any bad exam grade nor any consequence derived from wrong usage of this document (see the [license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrinoni/FormalLanguagesAndCompilers-Notes/master/LICENSE))\r\n\r\n### Dependences\r\nThe repository contains the LaTeX source code so you will need a LaTeX compiler.\r\nUnder Linux, `texlive` is your choice ([here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1017170/3493420) a simple guideline), but you can directly use some kind of TeX IDE like [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) or [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).\r\nIf you are a Windows user, I strongly recommend [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/), which has the great feature to auto-retrieve all the missing packages inside you LaTeX document.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of used LaTeX packages:\r\n* [toptesi](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/toptesi)\r\n* [float](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/float)\r\n* [Epstopdf](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/epstopdf)\r\n* [booktabs](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs)\r\n* [rotating](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/rotating)\r\n* [mathrsfs](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mathrsfs)\r\n* [amsmath](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath)\r\n* [caption](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/caption)\r\n\r\n### Compile\r\nOnce you choose the folder (e.g., `~/git_repoes`) and clone the repository (`git clone <git_repo_address>`) you can compile the code, in order to obtain the final PDF.\r\nAssuming that you're under Linux (and `pdflatex`), use the following commands:\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~/git_repo/FormalLanguagesAndCompilers-Notes\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\nIndeed, the repository comes with a `makefile` you can use to facilitate the compile step.\r\nThe command `make view` executes [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince); you can edit the `makefile` in order to use the reader you prefer.\r\n\r\nIf you use Windows, the `compile.bat` file can be used.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Marco Terrinoni](http://marcoterrinoni.altervista.org/)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNotes from the course \"Formal Languages and Compilers\" by [Marco Terrinoni](http://marcoterrinoni.altervista.org/) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\r\n\r\n![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)\r\n\r\n### Want to contribute?\r\n\r\nTake a look at this [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#intro)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
